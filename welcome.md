Thank you for registering for the [Computing AgroClimate Metrics in R](https://ucanr-igis.github.io/agroclimR/) workshop on **Friday December 2nd, 2022**, from **11am - 12:30pm** California time. I look forward to meeting everyone, and exploring weather driven metrics for agriculture in R.

You should receive a Google calendar invite for the workshop including a Zoom link. If you haven't received the Zoom link by the morning of the workshop, please contact the instructor.

The only preparation you really need to do is to create a free account on [posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (formerly known as RStudio Cloud). If you already have a RStudio Cloud account, your login will work on posit Cloud. This only takes a couple of minutes, but is required **before** the workshop. posit Cloud allows you to run RStudio in a browser. We'll be using it during the workshop to avoid common setup glitches. (Power users are welcome to use RStudio Desktop, but we won't have time to trouble-shoot setup issues. See the website for required packages.)

If you'd rather not do the hands-on exercises and just watch, that's fine also. Most of the time will be spent talking thru code examples, which you can come back to when needed.

The workshop materials will be available at <https://ucanr-igis.github.io/agroclimR/>. The recording will also be posted here in about a week.

If possible I highly recommend a **second monitor** for the hands-on exercises, so you can view the instructor's screen in one monitor while you work on RStudio on the other. A tablet or second laptop could suffice as your 'Zoom' device while you run RStudio Cloud on your laptop. If you're limited to just one screen (hopefully a big one), check out [these tips](https://ucanr-igis.github.io/caladaptr-res/workshops/ca_intro_feb22/workspace_tips.html) for viewing Zoom and an application window side-by-side.

Thanks and if you have any questions please let me know.

Best,\
Andy Lyons\
Instructor
